#Brackets
## How it works:
For those of you who don't know anything about soccer, their tournaments  usually have a group stage and a knockout stage. 

## Group Stage
During the group stage, all the teams are split into groups of 4 teams each. Every team in the group plays against every other team and the two best teams in each group make it into the knockout stage. The other two are eliminated. Each win is worth 3 points for the team and a tie is worth 1. During this stage, you'll be picking the actual score of the games. This is because there can be ties in the standings and the first tiebreaker is goal differential.

# Knockout Stage
This is the single elimination bracket that you all know and love. You only have to select the winner here, as there are no ties.

# Points
You will get 1 point for correctly predicting the outcome of a game in group play. Note that there are 3 possibilities here, so if you picked a team to win and they tie, you don't get the point.

You will get 2 points for each quarter final game, 4 for each semi, and finally 8 for the winner and 1 for the third place game.
